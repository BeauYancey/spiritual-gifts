			<h1>What Are Spiritual Gifts?</h1>
			<p>
				Spiritual gifts are divine abilities given by God to help us grow spiritually and serve others. 
				These gifts are not talents or learned skills, but manifestations of God's power working through 
				individuals. They are given according to God's wisdom, to bless the Church, strengthen faith, and 
				build His kingdom on earth.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Apostle Paul taught that “there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit” (
				<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?id=p4#4' target='_blank'>1 Corinthians 12:4</a>), 
				meaning that while each person may have different gifts, they all come from God. No one receives every 
				gift, but every believer is given at least one. As we recognize and develop these gifts, we can draw 
				closer to Jesus Christ and use them to uplift those around us.

				<h2>Can Spiritual Gifts Change Over Time?</h2>
				<p>
					Yes! Some gifts may be with us for a lifetime, while others may come as we seek them through faith and 
					righteous living. We can develop gifts we currently have, and God may bless us with new gifts as we grow. 
					The key is to “covet earnestly the best gifts” 
					(<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?id=p31#31' target='_blank'>
						1 Corinthians 12:31
					</a>) 
					and use them for good.

				<h2>How Should I Use My Spiritual Gifts?</h2>
				<p>
					Spiritual gifts are meant to bless others, not to elevate ourselves. They should be used with love, humility, 
					and a desire to serve. As we exercise our gifts, we fulfill Christ’s commandment to “love one another, as 
					I have loved you” 
					(<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?id=p34#34' target='_blank'>
						John 13:34
					</a>).
