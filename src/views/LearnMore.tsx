			<h1>What Are Spiritual Gifts?</h1>
			<hr/>
			<section>
				<p>
					Spiritual gifts are divine abilities given by God to help us grow spiritually and serve others. 
					These gifts are not just talents or learned skills, but manifestations of God's power working through 
					individuals. They are given according to God's wisdom, to bless the Church, strengthen faith, and 
					build His kingdom on earth.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Apostle Paul taught that “there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit” 
					(<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?id=p4#4' target='_blank'>
						1 Corinthians 12:4
					</a>), 
					meaning that while each person may have different gifts, they all come from God. No one receives every 
					gift, but every believer is given at least one. As we recognize and develop these gifts, we can draw 
					closer to Jesus Christ and use them to uplift those around us.

				<h2>Where Do We Learn About Spiritual Gifts?</h2>
				<p>
					The scriptures teach about spiritual gifts in multiple places, showing that they have always been an 
					important part of God's plan. Some of the key passages include:
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12' target='_blank'>1 Corinthians 12</a>
							 &nbsp;&ndash; Paul compares the Church to a body, where each member has a unique role. He lists various 
							 spiritual gifts and reminds us that all gifts are given by the Spirit for the benefit of all.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10' target='_blank'>Moroni 10</a>
							&nbsp;&ndash; Moroni urges us to "deny not the gifts of God," reminding us that God is the same yesterday, 
							today, and forever, and that spiritual gifts are still given to His people.
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46' target='_blank'>Doctrine & Covenants 46</a>
							&nbsp;&ndash; The Lord reveals that spiritual gifts are “given for the benefit of those who love [Him] and 
							keep all [His] commandments.” He also teaches that we should seek these gifts and be grateful for them.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Why Are Spiritual Gifts Important?</h2>
				<p>
					Spiritual gifts are not just personal blessings&mdash;they are meant to uplift, edify, and strengthen others. 
					When we use our gifts with love and humility, we help build God's kingdom and bring light to those around us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Spiritual gifts also remind us that we are all different but equally valuable in God's eyes. Just as a body 
					needs both hands and feet to function properly, the Church needs people with different gifts working together. 
					No gift is more important than another, and we are at our best when we support and appreciate each other's 
					unique strengths.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recognizing and developing our spiritual gifts also helps us grow closer to Christ. As we seek to use them for 
					good, we become more in tune with the Spirit and more aware of how God works in our lives.

				<h2>How Should I Use My Spiritual Gifts?</h2>
				<p>
					Spiritual gifts are not meant for personal recognition or status. They are given so that we can serve others 
					and glorify God. Jesus Christ taught, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love 
					one to another” (<a href='https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13?id=p34#34' target='_blank'>
					John 13:34</a>). When we exercise our gifts with love, we fulfill this commandment and become instruments in 
					God's hands.
				</p>
				<p>
					As we exercise our gifts, they become stronger. God blesses those who seek to serve, and as we faithfully 
					use our gifts, we may find new opportunities to bless and be blessed in return.
