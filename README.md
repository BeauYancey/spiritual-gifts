# Spiritual Gifts Quiz
This project is a Vite/React/TS web app that helps users identify and amplify their spiritual gifts. 

The spiritual gifts referenced in this project can be found in the following sources:
- [1 Corinthians 12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12)
- [D&C 46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46)
- [Moroni 10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10)
- [There Are Many Gifts](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1987/10/there-are-many-gifts) (Oct 1987 General Conference)

## How Can I Take the Quiz?
While the app is under development, the quiz will not be publicly accessible on the web. When I have finished the app, I will publish it at rela212.yanceydev.com or spiritual-gifts.yanceydev.com or something like that. Whatever domain I choose, I'll make sure to update this page when it has been published.
